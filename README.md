I can't express how much I hate this abomination.

Front is started with: npm run dev from frontend directory

Back is started with: python -m backend.main

The bot is @aicheckersbot 

Main problems to solve:

1) Bad checkers logic
2) No animations (can't add them - everything is going to hell if i try to)
3) Bad interface
4) Bad AI (I don't think it's gemeni thats answering on your moves)

You can't properly see the ui from miniapp, actually u can't see pretty much anything from here (I used localhost:5173 for debugging, it's working pretty much properly)

Dont forget to add .env file with tokens
